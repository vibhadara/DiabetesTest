## About Me

Hello! My name is Vibha Dara and I am a rising senior at Neuqua Valley High School in Illinois. I am very passionate about Computer Science and Statistics which is what I hope to be majoring in and working in in the future. My hobbies include swimming, playing badminton, listening to music, and hanging out with friends.

 

## About This Project

I was able to make this website through the [Kane's Free Data Science Course](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info) which teaches the basics of data science and statistics!
